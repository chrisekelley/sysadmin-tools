from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10854883/retrieve-just-deleted-document
get deleted history, e.g.:
curl http://example.iriscouch.com/test/_changes
you'll see deleted documents with $id and $rev, put empty document as new version, e.g.:

curl -X PUT http://example.iriscouch.com/test/$id?rev=$rev -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d {}
now you can get all revisions info, e.g:

curl http://example.iriscouch.com/test/$id?revs_info=true
obtain version before deletion, e.g.:

curl http://example.iriscouch.com/test/$id?rev=$prev_rev
put it back to couchdb, e.g.:

curl -X PUT http://example.iriscouch.com/test/$id?rev=$rev -H \'Content-Type: application/json\' -d \'$data\'
Let me know if you have any better way, or script.
